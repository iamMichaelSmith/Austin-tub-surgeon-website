    <p class="lead">If you manage rentals in Austin, Round Rock, or the surrounding area, refinishing can help you command better rents and reduce vacancy between tenants.</p>

      <h2>Why landlords choose refinishing over replacement</h2>
      <p>Full replacement means coordinating plumbers, tile crews, and waste hauling—often over several weeks. <a href="/bathtub-refinishing/">Bathtub refinishing</a> and <a href="/ceramic-tile-refinishing/">tile refinishing</a> give you a like-new appearance in days, not weeks.</p>
      <p>For most Central Texas rentals, refinishing is a smarter way to modernize bathrooms between tenants while keeping capital expenses under control.</p>

    <div class="card" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Best timing for make-ready projects</h2>
      <p>Refinishing is ideal right after move-out, before cleaning and painting. That way, any light dust from the project can be cleaned up once, and the new finish has time to cure before the next tenant moves in.</p>
      <p>Most tub and tile projects in rentals are completed in 1&ndash;2 days with 24&ndash;48 hours of cure time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Which surfaces are worth refinishing?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Yellowed or stained tubs that are structurally sound.</li>
        <li>Outdated tile colors that make units harder to lease.</li>
        <li>Vanity tops that are otherwise solid but visually tired.</li>
        <li>Small chips and cracks that can be handled with <a href="/chip-and-crack-repair/">professional repair</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the fixture is cracked through, leaking, or moving when stepped on, replacement may be safer. We will always give you an honest recommendation.</p>

      <h2>Setting tenant expectations</h2>
      <p>Refinished surfaces are durable, but they still need care. Share simple rules from our <a href="/care-maintenance/">care and maintenance</a> page—no abrasive cleaners, no suction-cup bathmats, and no standing water for long periods.</p>
