      <h2>Understanding the refinishing process</h2>
      <p>A common question from Austin parents and pet owners is: "Will the smell be dangerous?" It's a fair question. The chemicals used to etch the tub and the coatings used to resurface it do have a distinct odor during application.</p>
      <p>However, once the coating is dry, it is completely non-toxic and inert. The key to a safe project is what happens *during* those few hours of work.</p>

      <h2>Professional-grade ventilation</h2>
      <p>At Austin Tub Surgeon, we don't just crack a window. we use high-powered industrial exhaust fans and ducting to pull air directly from the bathroom and vent it outside. This creates negative pressure, preventing odors from drifting into the rest of your home.</p>
      <p>In most cases, the smell is gone within a few hours of us finishing the job. We recommend keeping pets and small children in a different part of the house (or out for a walk at Zilker Park!) while the fans are running.</p>

      <h2>Eco-friendly and low-VOC options</h2>
      <p>The industry has come a long way. Many of the older "tub paints" were loaded with lead and dangerous solvents. Our modern coatings are designed for indoor residential use. They are high-solids, low-VOC, and meet all modern safety standards.</p>
      <p>Once cured, the surface is as safe as the porcelain that was there before—and much easier to keep clean without using harsh, abrasive chemicals.</p>

      <h2>Practical tips for your project day</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear the path:</strong> Remove towels and toothbrushes from the bathroom.</li>
        <li><strong>AC Management:</strong> We may ask you to briefly turn off your HVAC or close specific vents to ensure our fans are doing all the work.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry Time:</strong> Usually 24 hours. The "new tub smell" disappears completely as the coating reaches its full hardness.</li>
      </ul>
