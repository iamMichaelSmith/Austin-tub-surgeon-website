      <h2>Typical lifespan in Central Texas homes</h2>
      <p>With proper prep, professional materials, and good care habits, refinished countertops in Austin and Round Rock can last many years. Heavy-use kitchens may see more wear than guest baths, but both benefit from the same durable coatings.</p>

      <h2>What affects how long the finish lasts?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Original surface:</strong> Laminate, tile, and cultured marble all have different prep steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily habits:</strong> Using cutting boards, trivets, and gentle cleaners protects the coating.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisture and heat:</strong> Standing water, steam, and hot pans can shorten the life of any surface.</li>
      </ul>
