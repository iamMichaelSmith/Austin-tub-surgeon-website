      <h2>The Austin rental market challenge</h2>
      <p>With the rapid growth in Austin, Round Rock, and Cedar Park, the rental market is more competitive than ever. Tenants are looking for modern, clean bathrooms, and outdated, stained tubs can be a dealbreaker that leads to long vacancies.</p>
      <p>However, full bathroom gut-jobs are rarely an option during a standard 3-5 day turnover window. This is where <a href="/bathtub-refinishing/">professional refinishing</a> becomes a property manager's best friend.</p>

      <h2>Speeding up the "Make-Ready" process</h2>
      <p>Our team specializes in high-speed, high-quality turnarounds for multi-unit properties. We can refinish a tub, surround, and counter in a single day, allowing your cleaning and painting crews to move in 24 hours later.</p>
      <p>By opting for <a href="/ceramic-tile-refinishing/">tile resurfacing</a>, you also eliminate the need to coordinate multiple contractors and avoid the debris and noise of a traditional demolition.</p>

    <div class="card" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Uniformity and branding</h2>
      <p>Many older Austin apartment complexes have a mix of bathtub colors and conditions. We can bring all units to a uniform "standard" white or almond finish. This makes your marketing photos consistent and your maintenance supplies easier to track across multiple buildings.</p>
