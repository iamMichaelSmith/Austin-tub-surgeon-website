      <h2>Typical Austin price range</h2>
      <p>Most Austin-area tub refinishing projects fall in a mid-range price band depending on condition and finish choice. Standard tubs in good shape are the most budget-friendly; heavy repairs or custom colors can add cost.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="cost-drivers" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>What drives the cost</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Surface condition:</strong> Chips, rust, or deep wear add repair time.</li>
        <li><strong>Material:</strong> Porcelain, fiberglass, and acrylic each require different prep.</li>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> Tight bathrooms and surrounds take longer to mask and protect.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish options:</strong> Color matching or specialty sheens can increase labor.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="compare-quotes" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>How to compare local quotes</h2>
      <p>When you compare Austin refinishing quotes, confirm that prep, repairs, ventilation, and a written warranty are included. The lowest price is not always the best value if prep or protection steps are skipped.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="refinish-vs-replace" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Refinishing vs. replacement</h2>
      <p>Replacement typically adds demolition, plumbing work, disposal, and tile repair. Refinishing avoids those costs and is usually completed in 1-2 days, which keeps total spend and disruption lower.</p>
