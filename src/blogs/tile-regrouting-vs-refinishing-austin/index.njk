      <h2>When to choose Tile Regrouting</h2>
      <p>If your tiles are in perfect condition and you generally like the color, but the grout is crumbling or moldy despite deep cleaning, regrouting is the answer. It involves scraping out the old grout and applying new material.</p>
      <p>Regrouting is purely a functional fix. It won't change the look of your tiles, but it will improve the waterproofing and cleanliness of your shower or floor.</p>

      <h2>When to choose Tile Refinishing</h2>
      <p>If you hate the color of your tile (we're looking at you, 1970s pink and green!) or if the grout lines are so stained they can't be saved, <a href="/ceramic-tile-refinishing/">professional tile refinishing</a> is the better option.</p>
      <p>Refinishing coats both the tile and the grout lines in a single, high-durability material. This completely seals the grout, making it 100% waterproof and impossible for mold to grow into the pores.</p>

      <h2>Central Texas Trends: The White Subway Look</h2>
      <p>Many Austin homeowners are opted to refinish their older square tiles in a bright, glossy "Subway White" finish. This creates a timeless look that feels much more expensive than it actually is, without the cost of a full tile tear-out.</p>
