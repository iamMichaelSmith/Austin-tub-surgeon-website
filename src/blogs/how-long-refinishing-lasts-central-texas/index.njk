      <h2>Typical lifespan</h2>
      <p>Most refinished tubs last for years when prep is done correctly and the surface is cared for. The lifespan depends more on prep and maintenance than on the original tub material.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="prep-matters" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Why prep matters most</h2>
      <p>Adhesion is everything. A professional process includes deep cleaning, sanding, etching, and repairs before coatings are applied. Skipping steps shortens lifespan.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="care-routine" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Care routine that extends life</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a mild liquid cleaner and soft sponge.</li>
        <li>Rinse after each use and wipe dry.</li>
        <li>Avoid suction-cup mats and abrasive cleaners.</li>
      </ul>
