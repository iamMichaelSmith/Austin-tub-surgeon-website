      <h2>What to know</h2>
      <p>For Austin-area homes, the best refinishing outcomes come from strong prep, realistic timelines, and clear care instructions after the job is complete.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm surface condition before pricing.</li>
        <li>Ask about cure windows and first-use timing.</li>
        <li>Use non-abrasive cleaners after refinishing.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Austin-specific tip</h2>
      <p>In Central Texas, hard water and heavy product buildup can shorten finish life if maintenance is skipped. A simple weekly wipe-down with approved cleaners helps preserve gloss and durability.</p>

      <h2>When to call a pro</h2>
      <p>If you see cracking, peeling, rust staining, or repeated chip damage, it is usually time for professional repair or full refinishing rather than another temporary patch.</p>
