    <p class="lead">Small chips in a tub can turn into stains, rust, and leaks. Here is how Austin homeowners can decide between a DIY patch and professional chip repair.</p>

      <h2>1. Understand what type of tub you have</h2>
      <p>Porcelain, fiberglass, acrylic, and cast iron tubs all respond differently to repair products. In Central Texas, we commonly see fiberglass and acrylic tubs in newer homes and apartments, and cast iron or porcelain in older Austin bungalows.</p>
      <p>If you are not sure, a quick photo is usually enough for a refinishing pro to identify the material.</p>

      <h2>2. When a DIY kit can work</h2>
      <p>For tiny surface nicks in a low-visibility area, a quality touch-up kit can be a short-term fix. Look for tub- and tile-safe products and follow cure-time directions closely.</p>
      <p>DIY is usually best when the chip is shallow, smaller than a dime, and not on the floor of the tub where you stand.</p>

      <h2>3. When to call a pro in Austin</h2>
      <p>Professional <a href="/chip-and-crack-repair/">chip and crack repair</a> is a better choice when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The chip is deep enough to expose metal or backing material.</li>
        <li>You see rust, spider cracks, or soft spots around the damage.</li>
        <li>The tub is in a rental, Airbnb, or multi-unit building where durability matters.</li>
        <li>You plan to refinish the entire tub and want repairs that will blend under the new finish.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>4. Why blending and color match matter</h2>
      <p>The hardest part of chip repair is not filling the damage—it is blending the repaired area so the patch is hard to spot. Austin Tub Surgeon uses professional fillers, bonding agents, and color-matched coatings to match sheen and color as closely as possible.</p>
      <p>That attention to detail is especially important on high-visibility areas like the floor of the tub or the front apron.</p>
