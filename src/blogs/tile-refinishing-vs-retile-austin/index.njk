    <div class="card" id="refinish" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Refinishing: fast and clean</h2>
      <p>Refinishing keeps the tile in place and updates the finish in 1-2 days. There is no demolition, which means less dust and lower total cost for Austin homes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="retile" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Re-tiling: full replacement</h2>
      <p>Re-tiling is better for severe water damage, failing substrate, or layout changes. It is a larger project with higher labor and longer timelines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="choose" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>How to choose in Austin</h2>
      <p>If tile is sound but dated, refinishing delivers a new look without remodel pricing. If the tile is loose or the wall needs rebuilding, consider re-tiling.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="pairing" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Pairing with tub refinishing</h2>
      <p>Many Austin homeowners refinish tub and tile together to get a consistent finish across the full shower surround.</p>
