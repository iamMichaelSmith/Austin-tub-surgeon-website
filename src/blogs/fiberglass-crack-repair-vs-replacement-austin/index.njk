      <h2>The tell-tale signs of fiberglass failure</h2>
      <p>Fiberglass tubs and showers are popular in many Austin neighborhoods for their affordability and lightweight nature. However, over time, they can develop stress cracks, especially if the base wasn't properly supported during installation.</p>
      <p>If you notice "spiderweb" cracks or a "crunching" sound when you step into the tub, the fiberglass is flexing. Left untreated, these minor issues can lead to major leaks that damage your subfloor.</p>

      <h2>When can it be repaired?</h2>
      <p>Most structural cracks in the floor of a fiberglass unit can be resolved with a professional <a href="/chip-and-crack-repair/">chip and crack repair</a>. This process involves reinforcing the area from below (often with structural foam or fiberglass mesh) and then resurfacing the spot to match the original finish.</p>
      <p>Structural reinforcement is key. A simple DIY putty kit might hide the crack for a week, but the flexing will eventually cause the patch to pop out.</p>

      <h2>When is replacement necessary?</h2>
      <p>Replacement is usually only necessary if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The unit has a massive hole that cannot be safely bridged.</li>
        <li>The entire bottom has completely "delaminated" or softened beyond help.</li>
        <li>You already have extensive mold growth in the subfloor due to a long-term leak.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For most Austin homeowners, a structural repair combined with <a href="/bathtub-refinishing/">professional refinishing</a> can extend the life of a fiberglass unit by 10-15 years at a fraction of the cost of a new install.</p>

      <h2>Local Austin Context: Hard Water & UV</h2>
      <p>In Central Texas, hard water can make fiberglass brittle over time. If your tub is located under a window, UV exposure can also fade and weaken the surface. Professional coatings today are designed to be UV-stable and much easier to clean than the original gel-coat.</p>
