      <h2>Why refinishing wins for most homes</h2>
      <p>Refinishing keeps your existing tub in place and restores the finish in 1-2 days. No demolition, no plumbing changes, and far less dust—ideal for Round Rock homeowners who want a fast refresh.</p>

    <div class="card" id="replacement-when" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>When replacement is the right call</h2>
      <p>Replacement is best if the tub is structurally damaged, the layout must change, or you are already in a full remodel that includes new plumbing and tile.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card" id="timeline" style="margin-top:1.5rem;">
      <h2>Timeline comparison</h2>
      <p>Refinishing is typically completed in 1-2 days plus cure time. Replacement often takes a week or more once demolition, plumbing, and tile work are added.</p>
    </div>

      <strong>Quick decision checklist</strong>
      <p>If your tub is sound but worn, refinishing is the best value. If the tub is cracked through or the layout needs to change, consider replacement.</p>
